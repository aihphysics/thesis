  abstract = {We argue that the study of heavy quarkonia, in particular that of \$\textbackslash Upsilon\$, produced back-to-back with an isolated photon in \$pp\$ collisions at the LHC is the best --and currently unique-- way to access the distribution of both the transverse momentum and the polarization of the gluon in an unpolarized proton. These encode fundamental information on the dynamics of QCD. We have derived analytical expressions for various transverse-momentum distributions which can be measured at the LHC and which allow for a direct extraction of the aforementioned quantities. To assess the feasibility of such measurements, we have evaluated the expected yields and the relevant transverse-momentum distributions for different models of the gluon dynamics inside a proton.},

  abstract = {The accelerator complex at CERN is a succession of machines that accelerate particles to increasingly higher energies to uncover the mysteries of the Universe. Each machine or accelerator boosts the energy of a beam of particles, before injecting the beam into the next machine in the sequence. In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \textendash{} dark blue line \textendash{} particle beams are accelerated up to the record energy of 6.5 TeV per beam. Most of the other smaller accelerators in the chain have their own experimental halls where beams are used for experiments at lower energies.},
